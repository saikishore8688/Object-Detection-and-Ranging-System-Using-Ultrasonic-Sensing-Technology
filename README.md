# Object-Detection-and-Ranging-System-Using-Ultrasonic-Sensing-Technology
This project is an embedded system designed to detect objects and measure their distance using ultrasonic sensing technology. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to transmit sound waves and calculate the distance of nearby objects based on the time taken for the echo to return.
